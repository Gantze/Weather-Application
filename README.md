# Weather-Application

1. In order to run the weather application, first you need to clone the Weather-Application Github Repository into your PC. Then, you have to write the 'npm install' and 'npm run start' in your terminal, in order to run the local server (http://localhost:3000).

2. The weather application has a 'Choose theme' functionality, by clicking the drop-down list from the left-top corner of the screen. Through this, you can choose to apply on the screen 1 out of 4 different themes (Day, Night, Rain or Snow). Actually, the backgound image and the title color will change.

3. The app is linked to openweathermap.org API, so you can search (in the 'Search' input field) for the real weather details (location, temperature in Celsius degrees, an icon showing the weather type, weather type, humidity and wind speed) of around 200,000 different cities on the globe. By default, the app shows the current weather details of your current location. You can inititalize a search by clicking the search button (magnifying glass icon) as well as by pressing the 'Enter' key.

4. There are 2 different buttons for displaying the weather information (Current weather and Weather forecast). By clicking the 'Weather forecast' button, the app will show only the weather forecast for the next 3 days of your/searched location (the same weather details, starting from tomorrow 00:00), displaying data for every 3h. By clicking the 'Current weather' button, the app will show again only the current weather details of the current/searched location.

5. The weather app has an 'Add to favorites' functionality, so whenever you wish to add a location to favorites, search for that specific location then click the 'Add to favorites' button. This way, the location name will appear in the drop-down list available under the 'Current weather' and 'Weather forecast' buttons, in order to be selected later, so the app will display the weather details of the chosen location.

6. The app is responsive for different types of screen sizes.
